How to run Java implementation :

Implementation in Java :

a. GlobalLock - Global lock implementation.
b. Grained Lock -  Lazy Fine Grained Locking implementation.
c. Stm - Software transaction implementation that use Deuce Stm.
d. StmImprov - Software transaction implementation that use Deuce Stm,our improve implementation of Stm.

In order to run any of the applications :
1. use the application folder use the command ant compile to compile the application.
2. only for the Software transactional memory application (c and d) make sure that the jar file deuceAgent-1.3.0 is inside build folder.
3. only for the Software transactional memory application (c and d) add -javaagent:deuceAgent-1.3.0.jar to the run command java 
4. For each application the following argument are needed :
	4.1 <number Of Threads> - number of threads to run parallel.
	4.2 <max key> 			- the max key that can be in the leap lists. 
	4.3 <key Range> 		- Range size of keys to look for when calling range query. range query will look for key from 'low' to 'low' + rq_size
	4.4 <seconds>			- The time that the test will run in seconds.
	4.5 <number of lists>	- number of lists L that will be in the L-LeapList.
	4.6 <LookUp Proportion> - percentage of the look operation.
	4.7 <Range Proportion>	- percentage of the range query operation. 
	4.8 <Insert Proportion> - percentage of Update, the remove percentage will be: 100 - (LookUp percentage + Range Query percentage + Update percentage).

	Example for a run : java utils.Test1 8 100000 1000 10 4 60 30 9
					The test will run for 10 seconds and with 8 threads. 60% of the operations will be lookup operations, 30% of the operations will be range query operations in the size of 1000 keys. 
					9% of the operations will be update and 1% of the operations will be remove. keys will be generated randomly from 0 to 100000,there will be 4 lists in the database and each will start with an initial set of 100000 keys
					
	Example for Software transactional memory run :
	java -javaagent:deuceAgent-1.3.0.jar utils.Test1 8 100000 1000 10 4 60 30 9
					The test will run for 10 seconds and with 8 threads. 60% of the operations will be lookup operations, 30% of the operations will be range query operations in the size of 1000 keys. 
					9% of the operations will be update and 1% of the operations will be remove. keys will be generated randomly from 0 to 100000,there will be 4 lists in the database and each will start with an initial set of 100000 keys
